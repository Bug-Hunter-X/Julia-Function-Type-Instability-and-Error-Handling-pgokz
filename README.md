# Julia Function Type Instability and Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Julia related to type instability and error handling.  The provided Julia code showcases a function that might unexpectedly produce type instability, and the solution file illustrates a way to resolve it, enhancing the code's efficiency and robustness.

## Bug Description
The `myfunction` in `bug.jl` potentially has type instability due to the differing return types when `x` is positive and negative. Additionally, the error handling for negative values is not robust and may not convey helpful information to the user.

## Solution
The solution code in `bugSolution.jl` addresses both these issues by explicitly defining the return type and providing better error handling.

## Usage
Simply run both the `bug.jl` and `bugSolution.jl` files using the Julia interpreter to compare the behavior of the original code and the improved version.
